I would focus on the things that unblock real usage: 
    1. Validation so bad inputs fail fast with good error messages
    2. JSON/CSV outputs since different stakeholders need different formats, and 
    3. a utilization parameter since staffing involves cost-safety tradeoffs.
I would skip nice-to-haves like a web UI for now—the CLI is powerful enough and can be called from anywhere.
